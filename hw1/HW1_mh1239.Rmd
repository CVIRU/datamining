## R Markdown and binplot

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. Foe this document, I demonstrated some examples of function binplot(),

Firstly, the binplot():
```{r binplot()}
binplot <- function(x,y,nr=20,nc=20, scale="raw") {
zx = c(1:nr,rep(1,nc),1+trunc( nr*(x- min(x))/(max(x)-min(x)) ))
zx[zx>nr] = nr
zy = c(rep(1,nr),1:nc,1+trunc( nc*(y- min(y))/(max(y)-min(y)) ))
zy[zy>nc] = nc
z = table(zx,zy); z[,1]=z[,1]-1; z[1,]=z[1,]-1;
if (scale=="l") z= log(1+z)
image(z=t(z),x=seq(length=nr+1,from=min(x),to=max(x)),
y= seq(length=nc+1,from=min(y),to=max(y)),
xlab="",ylab="", col=topo.colors(100))
}

```

## Basic Usage

You can use binplot() to make scatter plot in a 'bin' way, for example:

```{r Basic Usage}
x = rnorm(10000) ; y = rnorm(10000)
plot(x,y)
binplot(x,y,10,10)
```

## Advanced Usage by changing the number of observations

The plot is becoming more and more clear when the number of bin is increasing.

```{r Advanced Usage}
binplot(x,y,50,50)
binplot(x,y,100,100)
```

## Advanced Usage by performing 'log' transformation

The plot is enlarged after log transformation.

```{r Advanced Usage3}
binplot(x,y,100,100,'l')
binplot(x,y,500,500,'l')
```

## Finding something invisible

The relationship is hidden in the scatter plot, however, with binplot() we can find those invisible
relationship since the number of dots in a bin can be represented by color

```{r More usage}
ux = rnorm(5000)/3
uy = ux^2 -0.5
par(mar=c(4,4,1,1))
plot(x=c(y,uy),y=c(x,ux),pch=20,col=3,xlab="X",ylab="Y",cex=0.7)
binplot(c(y,uy)+20,c(x,ux),100,100)
binplot(c(y,uy)+20,c(x,ux),100,100,"l")
```
